# Packet Sniffer Tool

This project is a packet sniffer tool designed to capture and analyze network packets. The tool displays relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. **Ensure the ethical use of this tool for educational purposes only.**

## Features

- Capture network packets in real-time.
- Display source and destination IP addresses.
- Identify and display protocols used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- Display payload data of captured packets.
- Simple command-line interface.

## Requirements

- `scapy` library for packet capturing and analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

## Ethical Considerations

- **Permission**: Always obtain explicit permission from the network owner before capturing network traffic.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that your use of this software complies with local laws and regulations. Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical.
- **Transparency**: Be transparent about the purpose of using this software. Packet sniffers can be used for malicious purposes, and it is essential to use them responsibly.

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational purposes only. The developer is not responsible for any misuse of this software. Use it responsibly and ethically.

## Acknowledgments

- This packet sniffer tool is inspired by network security practices and aims to demonstrate the importance of ethical considerations when developing and using network monitoring tools. Special thanks to the developers of the `scapy` library for making packet capturing and analysis in Python straightforward and efficient.
